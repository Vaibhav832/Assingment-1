    "\n",
    "1. Mean: The mean is the average of a set of data and is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of observations. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency when the data is normally distributed and there are no extreme values (outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is the middle value in a set of data when the observations are ordered from lowest to highest (or highest to lowest). The median is a useful measure of central tendency when the data is skewed or has extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a set of data. The mode is a useful measure of central tendency when the data has distinct peaks or modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Standard deviation: The standard deviation is a measure of variability that indicates how much the observations deviate from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the observations are closer to the mean, while a larger standard deviation indicates that the observations are more spread out.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Range: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a set of data. The range is a useful measure of variability when the data has extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Interquartile range (IQR): The IQR is the difference between the third quartile (75th percentile) and the first quartile (25th percentile) of a set of data. The IQR is a useful measure of variability that is less sensitive to extreme values than the range."
