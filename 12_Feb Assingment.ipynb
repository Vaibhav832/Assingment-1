    "Ans-1) An exception in Python is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are raised when a program encounters a runtime error, such as division by zero, accessing an index that is out of range, or trying to open a file that does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions and syntax errors are two different types of errors in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax error occurs when the code written is not valid according to the syntax rules of the language. For example, if you forget to close a parenthesis, or if you use the wrong type of quotes in a string, Python will raise a syntax error. These errors are usually easy to spot and fix, as they prevent the code from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception, on the other hand, occurs when the code is syntactically correct but encounters an error during execution. Unlike syntax errors, exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks. This allows you to write code that can gracefully handle runtime errors, making your code more robust and user-friendly."
